Declare your property’s 2024 occupancy status by April 30, 2025.

Determining Occupancy Status Properties Where Declaration is Required Residential property owners are required to declare the occupancy status of their property every year, even if they live there or qualify for an exemption.

Vendors should provide a copy of the completed and filed declaration of occupancy status to the purchaser. Purchases should do their due diligence to ensure they are aware of property tax liabilities. Who should submit the occupancy status? Scenario A: The property sold within the taxation year being declared Either the vendor or purchaser can submit a declaration.

Power of Sale Buyers purchasing a property by way of power of sale are purchasing the property in an “as is” condition and are responsible for the associated taxes. Like property taxes, the Vacant Home Tax is attached to the property, not the individual. Power of sale does not constitute an exemption.
